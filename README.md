Reflection on your experience with this assignment: 
I found visual prototyping to be very interesting, kind of like designing a game system, and it's definitely the hardest part of this assignment, or more specifically, how to define separate conditions that process the token queue. After completing it I feel like I've gain a deeper understanding of how queue and stack works and how they are applicable in different circumstance based on their FIFO and FILO nature. I feel like the instruction of this assignment is very clear, and the provided testing classes are great and very rewarding when the code successfully passed these tests. Because I didn't completelly follow the instruction and performed the algorithm based on my own understanding of wikipedia description, it might looks slightly different. I think this thought process is worthwhile eventhough not necessary.

This assignment does lend itself to more visual prototyping, so please feel free to go this route. Are you including slides, pseudocode, comments, or something else? NA
